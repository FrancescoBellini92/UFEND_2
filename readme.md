# Udacity Front End ND project 2

This repo contains a landing page with dynamic behaviour added with Javascript

BEM methodoloy has been applied to promote DRY code and style encapsulation, and a mobile-first approach was followed to good cross-device user experience.

On the Javascript side, measures have been taken to keep performance overhead low: 
 - event delegation was used to avoid the negative impact of many event handlers
 - DOM querying / manipulation was limited (e.g., by caching elements, by operating on DocumentFragments)

Moreovover, a main closure was provided to ensure variables encapsulation.
